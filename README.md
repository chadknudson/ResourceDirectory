# ResourceDirectory
Simple utility to display the names of embedded resources in a .DLL or .EXE file. Just build this file and run it with a command line parameter of -f supplying the path of the .DLL or .EXE file for which you wish to see the embedded resources contained within.

```
ResourceDirectory.exe -f "C:\MyProject\bin\Debug\MyProject.dll"
```
